In this tutorial, we will guide you through building an AI agent from scratch. We’ll build, deploy, implement, and test a webpage FAQ generator AI agent within a frontend project. This agent will generate a selected number of FAQs based on specified topics and keywords. We’ll also explore how to enhance the accuracy of an AI agent by instructing it to use a predefined set of documents instead of relying solely on web data.

**Tech Stack:**

- **OpenAI:** The most used AI model provider. To follow along with this tutorial, you’ll need to have an account with them.

- **BaseAI:** A free and open-source web AI framework for building serverless AI agents with Node.js and TypeScript.

- **Langbase:** A powerful serverless platform for building and deploying AI products.

**Benefits of Building Your Own AI Agent:**

- Leverage the power of large language models (LLMs) without the limits of third-party tools.

- Flexible customization tailored to your specific project needs.

- Seamless integration with your workflow and toolset.

- Full control over the processed data.

- Better privacy and security.

- Scalability that meets your changing needs.

- Cost efficiency in the long run.

- Full alignment with your brand identity.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Set Up BaseAI:** Install BaseAI and configure it to work with your project.

2. **Create AI Pipes:** Develop serverless AI agents using BaseAI's unified API for all LLMs.

3. **Implement AI Memory:** Utilize BaseAI's serverless Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agent for long-term memory functionality.

4. **Integrate with Langbase:** Deploy your AI agents using Langbase for efficient management and scaling.

5. **Develop the FAQ Generator:** Build the AI-powered FAQ generator within your frontend project, ensuring it can generate FAQs based on specified topics and keywords.

6. **Enhance Accuracy:** Instruct your AI agent to use a predefined set of documents to improve accuracy, rather than relying solely on web data.

By following this guide, you'll be equipped to create a robust AI agent tailored to your project's needs, enhancing user experience and functionality.
