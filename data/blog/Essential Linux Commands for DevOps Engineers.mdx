As a DevOps engineer, your interaction with Linux systems is a daily affair. Mastering a core set of Linux commands is crucial for managing servers, automating tasks, and troubleshooting issues efficiently. This post highlights some of the most important commands you should know.

**Navigation and File Manipulation:**

- `cd`: Change directory. `cd /path/to/directory` moves you to the specified directory. `cd ..` moves you one directory up.
- `pwd`: Print working directory. Shows your current location in the file system.
- `ls`: List directory contents. `ls -l` provides a detailed listing, including permissions, ownership, and file size. `ls -a` shows hidden files.
- `touch`: Create an empty file. `touch filename` creates a new file.
- `cp`: Copy files and directories. `cp source destination`.
- `mv`: Move or rename files and directories. `mv source destination`.
- `rm`: Remove files and directories. `rm filename` removes a file. `rm -r directory` removes a directory and its contents recursively (use with caution!).
- `mkdir`: Create a directory. `mkdir directoryname`.
- `rmdir`: Remove an empty directory.
- `cat`: Display file contents. `cat filename`.
- `less`: View file contents one page at a time (for larger files). `less filename`. Use space to go forward, 'b' to go back, and 'q' to quit.
- `head`: Display the first few lines of a file. `head -n 10 filename` shows the first 10 lines.
- `tail`: Display the last few lines of a file. `tail -n 10 filename` shows the last 10 lines.
- `echo`: Display text or variables. `echo "Hello, world!"`. Useful for scripting.
- `wc`: Word count. `wc filename` shows the number of lines, words, and bytes in a file.

**Process Management:**

- `ps`: List running processes. `ps aux` provides a comprehensive list of processes.
- `top`: Display dynamic real-time view of running processes. Use 'q' to quit.
- `kill`: Terminate a process. `kill PID` (where PID is the Process ID). `kill -9 PID` forces termination (use with caution).
- `bg`: Put a process in the background.
- `fg`: Bring a background process to the foreground.

**Networking:**

- `ifconfig` or `ip addr`: Display network interface information. `ip addr` is the modern replacement for `ifconfig`.
- `ping`: Test network connectivity. `ping hostname or IP address`.
- `netstat`: Display network connections. `netstat -tulnp` shows listening ports and associated processes.
- `ssh`: Secure shell. `ssh username@hostname` to connect to a remote server.
- `curl` or `wget`: Transfer data from or to a server using URLs. `curl URL` or `wget URL`.
- `nslookup`: Query DNS servers to find IP addresses associated with domain names, and vice-versa.

**System Monitoring:**

- `df`: Display disk space usage. `df -h` shows human-readable format.
- `du`: Display directory space usage. `du -sh` shows summary in human-readable format.
- `free`: Display memory usage. `free -h` shows human-readable format.
- `uptime`: Show how long the system has been running.
- `w`: Show who is currently logged in.

**Other Useful Commands:**

- `grep`: Search for patterns in text. `grep "pattern" filename`.
- `find`: Search for files and directories. `find . -name "filename"`.
- `chmod`: Change file permissions. `chmod 755 filename`.
- `chown`: Change file ownership. `chown user:group filename`.
- `tar`: Archive files. `tar -czvf archive.tar.gz directory` (create a compressed archive). `tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz` (extract a compressed archive).
- `man`: Display the manual page for a command. `man commandname`.

This is not an exhaustive list, but it covers the commands you'll likely use most frequently. Regular practice and exploration will solidify your understanding and make you a more efficient DevOps engineer. Don't hesitate to use the `man` command to learn more about any command.
