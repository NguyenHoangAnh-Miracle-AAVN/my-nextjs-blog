## Considerations for Choosing a UI Library

When selecting a UI component library for your project, consider factors like bundle size, customization options, and documentation quality. Installation typically follows one of these patterns:

- **Using npm or yarn:** Install the library as a dependency in your project.
- **CDN:** Include the library via a Content Delivery Network for quick prototyping.

Most libraries support tree-shaking for optimal bundle sizes. Here are some best practices:

- **Mix and Match:** Don't hesitate to use components from different libraries when needed.
- **Customize:** Most libraries support theming and styling customization.
- **Accessibility:** Verify accessibility features of components before implementation.
- **Performance:** Monitor bundle size impact when adding new components.

By carefully selecting and integrating these libraries, you can enhance your React and Next.js applications with modern, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces.
