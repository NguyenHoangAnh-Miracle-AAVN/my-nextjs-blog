In this case study, we explore the creative journey behind ChainGPT Labs, examining how the Sigma Software Design team developed a visually cohesive and functionally advanced platform to support the next generation of Web3 startups. From branding to 3D design and interactive web development, this analysis highlights the challenges, solutions, and tools used to bring this vision to life.

## The Client’s Story

Before we enter the Lab®, let’s briefly discuss ChainGPT’s existing product ecosystem.

ChainGPT is a blockchain-focused infrastructure platform that provides AI-powered tools and solutions specifically tailored for the Web3/crypto ecosystem. Since 2023, we’ve been working with the client’s team to create the brand identity, design and develop an award-winning website, multiple web applications such as a Generative NFT Creation Tool, a Web3 Security Extension, and many more.

The brand’s expanding product family now includes 10+ products, all designed and developed by the same teams. Designing multiple products for the same client poses a challenging requirement: the visual identity of each new product should be inherited from the primary branding but still look unique and product-tailored.

## It All Started With the Cute 3D Robot

ChainGPT branding is centered around the robo-mascot – a friendly little robot with the brand’s logo around his face. I designed and rigged this character back in 2023 using Cinema 4D & Octane Render. Today, we use him across all ChainGPT products in different variations, skins, environments, etc. Essentially, he’s as important to the brand identity as the logo.

We customize the appearance of this robot based on the product’s purpose, accent color, and meaning. The team has already created more than 15 variations of this little fella, including light, dark, spaceman, a judge called Mr. Robotson, and many more.

## Entering the Lab

In February 2024, the client’s team approached us to expand the brand ecosystem even further by introducing a new member to the product family: ChainGPT Labs.

ChainGPT Labs is a platform that focuses on supporting innovative Web3 startups. It provides funding, incubation, and acceleration services to help these startups grow, offering resources like strategic partnerships and tokenization strategies.

What we knew from the start:

1. We needed to develop a distinctive visual identity for this new product while ensuring that it remained visually connected to the main product;
2. We should probably use a light theme to convey the all-white feeling of the laboratory. At the time, all other ChainGPT products were dark-themed, so we had the challenge of adjusting the existing visual identity for light backgrounds to work as well as dark ones;
3. Our robo-mascot should be used in the UI, but this time, we would adjust him for the experimental laboratory environment. Our goal was to convey the meaning of startup incubation and funding;
4. The nature of this project is as experimental as it could get (even the ‘Labs’ name), so we wanted to convey that meaning by choosing a unique display typeface for headings, creating a unique (a bit brutalist) grid structure, etc.;
5. We should use Webflow to allow the maximum flexibility of content management for the client’s team. This website has a dedicated blog section, so we needed to ensure that content managers could create new posts as quickly and efficiently as possible.

We took this list into work and started an exciting process of exploring unique layout possibilities.

## 3D Illustrations & On-Scroll Interactions

Together with Sigma’s in-house 3D designer, Dmytro, we took our existing 3D model of the robot and transformed it into the Lab-oriented scene by adding sci-fi capsules, incubation chambers, and other laboratory-inspired elements. We made sure that all 3D scenes conveyed the meaning of experimentation as much as possible by choosing a striking white and orange palette.

All 3D illustrations (Hero Sequence, Robot, Coin) are implemented as videos with alpha channel, allowing for seamless integration into the website's design.

## Conclusion

The design and development of ChainGPT Labs presented unique challenges and opportunities. By leveraging 3D design, interactive web development, and a cohesive visual identity, we were able to create a platform that not only supports the next generation of Web3 startups but also embodies the innovative spirit of the ChainGPT brand.
