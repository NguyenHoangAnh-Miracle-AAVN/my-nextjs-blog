As a software developer, having a robust portfolio website is essential to showcase your abilities and experiences. To assist fellow developers, I have designed a portfolio website using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and EmailJS. This article provides a step-by-step guide on setting up the project, along with the GitHub repository link.

**Live Preview:** [abusaid.me](https://abusaid.me)

**GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/said7388/developer-portfolio](https://github.com/said7388/developer-portfolio)

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**

Begin by cloning the repository and navigating to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/said7388/developer-portfolio.git
cd developer-portfolio
```

\*\*Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install all necessary packages using npm or yarn:

```
npm install
# or
yarn
```

\*\*Step 3: Customize Personal Data

Update the personal data in utils/data/personalData.js to reflect your information. For example:

```
export const personalData = {
  name: "Your Name",
  profile: "/profile.png",
  designation: "Full-Stack Software Developer",
  description: "A brief description about yourself.",
  email: "your.email@example.com",
  phone: "+1234567890",
  address: "Your City, Country",
  github: "https://github.com/yourusername",
  facebook: "https://www.facebook.com/yourprofile",
  linkedIn: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile",
  twitter: "https://twitter.com/yourusername",
  stackOverflow: "https://stackoverflow.com/users/youruserid/yourname",
  leetcode: "https://leetcode.com/yourusername/",
  devUsername: "yourDevToUsername",
  resume: "link_to_your_resume.pdf",
};
```

Replace the devUsername property with your dev.to username to fetch all blogs from your dev.to account.

\*\*Step 4: Configure EmailJS

Set up EmailJS to enable users to send emails to you through the contact form. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your EmailJS credentials:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
```

To obtain these credentials:

- Sign up at EmailJS.
- Create an email service using Gmail and note the Service ID.
- Create an email template and note the Template ID.
- Retrieve your Public Key from the EmailJS account dashboard.

\*\*Step 5: Run the Development Server

Start the development server using npm or yarn:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Your portfolio website should now be up and running. If you find this project helpful, please consider starring the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/said7388/developer-portfolio). You can also connect with author on LinkedIn.

Note: This project was inspired by the design of codewithmosh.com.
