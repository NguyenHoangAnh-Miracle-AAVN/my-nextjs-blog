JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are widely used for secure data transmission in single-page applications. However, improper storage of JWTs can expose applications to security risks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. This article discusses best practices for securely storing JWTs to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

**Understanding JWT Storage Risks**

Storing JWTs in client-side storage mechanisms like localStorage or sessionStorage can make them susceptible to XSS attacks. If an attacker injects malicious scripts into your application, they can access these tokens, compromising user data and application integrity.

**Best Practices for Secure JWT Storage**

1. **Use HTTP-Only Cookies**: Store JWTs in HTTP-only cookies to prevent client-side scripts from accessing them. This approach mitigates the risk of XSS attacks.

2. **Implement SameSite Cookies**: Set the SameSite attribute to 'Strict' or 'Lax' to protect against CSRF attacks by restricting how cookies are sent with cross-site requests.

3. **Ensure Secure Transmission**: Always transmit JWTs over HTTPS to protect them from being intercepted during transmission.

4. **Set Appropriate Expiration**: Assign a reasonable expiration time to JWTs to limit the window of opportunity for attackers.

5. **Regularly Rotate Keys**: Periodically rotate signing keys to enhance security and reduce the impact of potential key compromises.
