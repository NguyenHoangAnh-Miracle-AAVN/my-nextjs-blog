# **Hello, World! I'm Anh Nguyen.**

## _Java Developer | Backend Enthusiast | Aquatic Adventurer_

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Anh, a passionate Java developer with a penchant for all things code-related. Whether I'm diving into Java, scripting with JavaScript, or orchestrating containers with Docker, I thrive on turning ideas into elegant solutions.

### **What's in My Dev Toolkit?**

- **Java**: My trusty companion since the early days. I've crafted robust applications, danced with Spring, and even tamed the occasional wild NullPointerException.

- **JavaScript**: The dynamic duo with Java! When I'm not slinging Java code, you'll find me sprinkling some JavaScript magicâ€”whether it's building interactive web apps or adding that extra flair to my UI.

- **Docker**: Containers are my jam. I love how Docker lets me package up my apps, ship them across environments, and whisper sweet nothings to Kubernetes.

- **Next.js & React**: Frontend wizardry! Next.js keeps my React apps snappy, SEO-friendly, and delightful. And yes, I've had my fair share of "useState" moments.

- **CSS**: Styling is an art form. I've battled flexbox quirks, danced with media queries, and occasionally pondered the mysteries of CSS specificity.

### **Behind the Scenes: The Backend Chronicles**

- **Hibernate**: When databases beckon, I answer. Hibernate helps me bridge the gap between Java objects and relational databases. It's like matchmaking for data!

- **Database Skills**: SQL? No problem. I've optimized queries, normalized schemas, and even had a heated debate about whether "SELECT \* FROM users" is acceptable (spoiler: it's not).

- **Swimming & Playtime**: When I'm not debugging, I'm probably doing laps in the pool. There's something meditative about gliding through waterâ€”it's my escape from curly braces and semicolons.

- **Gaming**: Yes, I'm a grown-up who still gets excited about pixelated adventures. From retro classics to open-world epics, I've battled dragons, saved princesses, and occasionally respawned.

### **Age in Bytes**

At 37, I've seen tech evolve faster than a Java thread. But you know what? I'm still as curious as ever. Learning, adapting, and occasionally Googlingâ€”because even seasoned devs need Stack Overflow.

So, welcome to my digital abode! Stick around for code snippets, swimming pool musings, and the occasional "404 Not Found" joke. Let's build something awesome together! ðŸš€
